# WorkyGO



This project aims to run workflows with containerized steps. Each step will run inside a container. This way the user can control the runtime of each step. Each step can have multiple child steps and zero or multiple requirement steps.

## Major functionalities :
- User can export workflows and use them in other workflows as exiting steps or share them with other users.
- User can manage workflows through an API or a Web UI.
- User can authenticate to the web UI with OAuth (GitHub / Google).
- User can authenticate to the API with an API key.
- User can trigger job manually by completing a form.
- User can create custom triggers for their workflows.
- User can add steps through existing images or custom Dockerfiles.
